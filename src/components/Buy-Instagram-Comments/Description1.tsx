              Instagram Likes are all well and good, but comments are the real
              currency of the Instagram Influencer marketplace. After all, it
              takes far more effort on the part of the viewer to formulate and
              type a comment than it does to simply tap a {'"'}heart{'"'} icon.
              The Instagram algorithm understands this, so it automatically
              ranks posts with more comments higher. This is also same for
              Instagram views.

            <span>
              This increased visibility is the primary reason why businesses and
              influencers choose to promote themselves via paid Instagram
              comments. In fact, in most cases, the more comments they purchase,
              the more organic comments they’ll get. This essentially gives
              these account access to a {'"'}loophole{'"'} in the algorithm that
              will continually reward their posts with better and better
              rankings.

          <span>
            <span>
              But there’s a lot more to paying for Instagram comments than that.
              For instance, you can’t rely on them to carry your entire
              Instagram brand. You still need to be putting out engaging
              content, interacting with Instagram followers, and courting new
              audience members. Still, there’s no denying that Instagram is
              extremely competitive. To that point, using a comments service is
              a great way to get a leg up on other Influencers while
              simultaneously boosting your credibility.

              In the end, it’s all about visibility. If you aren’t getting seen,
              it doesn’t matter how hard you work or how great your posts are.
              But If you can find ways to get comments on your posts (organic or
              paid), you can expose more potential followers to your budding
              brand.

              There are a number of approaches you can take to getting more
              comments on your posts. Below, we’ll outline some of the top
              strategies that you can start using today. After that, we’ll go
              into a little more detail about the comment-buying process,
              including how it works, what results to aim for, and how much you
              can expect to pay.

              People love to get something for nothing, so contests and
              giveaways tend to get tons of social media attention. Whether you
              use Instagram as your primary promotional tool or use it in
              connection with Facebook or TikTok, promoting a giveaway is a
              surefire way to increase interaction and engagement.

              In many cases, Influencers will make a comment the {'"'}entry fee
              {'"'} for the contest. Though a little straightforward, this is
              definitely a surefire way to get results. Another strategy is to
              simply set up the contest in a way that encourages users will
              inevitably lead to increased comments and likes.

              Chances are that if you want more comments on your Instagram
              posts, you have aspirations of becoming an Influencer. So,
              influence! Don’t just sit around and hope for comments to come
              your way. Go ahead and ask for them. It might surprise you to find
              out just how well this works, particularly if you arrange your
              content in a way that is conversational or asks a direct question.

              Most Instagrammers operate within some sort of niche. It could be
              travel or health and beauty or education – it doesn’t matter.
              However, if you want to maximize your visibility in that niche,
              you need to monitor trending hashtags. Just like with news, people
              are drawn to topical content. If you use trending hashtags in your
              posts, you will be more likely to increase both ranking and
              engagement.

              The better you know your audience, the better you can promote
              engagement. One strategy for this is to ensure that you’re posting
              at times when your audience is most active. This will increase the
              chances they will see your post, therefore giving them the
              opportunity to comment and interact.

              We all love a good sunset photo, but research shows that posts
              with faces in them actually generate 32% more comments than those
              that don’t. So even if it’s not typical to your niche, make sure
              you post lots of photos of yourself, friends, or people related to
              the content. If you do, you’re likely to see a big jump in
              engagement.

              And while it should come as no surprise at all that people love
              cute and cuddly animals, it may surprise you that animal faces are
              also a great way to boost your Instagram engagement. Even if the
              only comments you get are {'"'}awww{'"'} and {'"'}so cute,{'"'}{' '}
              you’re still going to move up in the rankings.
